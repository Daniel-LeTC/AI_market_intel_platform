Water temperature is good can’t complain , cold water doesn’t last of course bc it’s not insulated, but good water cup however I did not like that it still leaks only if the cap is left open. If the spout is left out and you put it upside it will leak through this tiny hole right at the top. It only stays sealed when closed, so it was only an issue when my toddler didn’t close her cup and left it open where it could just leak on the bed for example. But overall cute cup for little ones",

Additionally, the leak-proof feature and ease of opening also get mixed reviews, with some reporting it doesn't leak while others say it spills, and while some find the lid easy to close, others mention it's extremely hard to close.

But for what it's worth, the 27oz capacity, and printed images are good quality. Condensation, yeah, there's a lot of that if you put ice in it. It's not one of those higher end vacuum sealed dual walled cups. I got the harry potter version as well. Also gets extremely wet from condensation and has no sort of grip so the kids sometimes have a hard time holding them. They leak a lot. Easy to open for a 2 year old to drink from. Easily opened by an 8 year old to refill. Just don't over tighten it.",

Looks as sturdy as the smaller ones, and probably even easier to wash since there is no fiddly straw (though when my kiddo was smaller the straw was helpful to prevent spills). The color is nice too. I like that it also comes with name labels you can write your child's name on it's a nice touch. So far no leaks like the other thermos containers (but as always make sure the top is screwed on). There is an extra ring tab to help hold the top closed to prevent leaks, just very well thought out. But note if your child struggles with dexterity it is a two-step process. It fits in a backpack waterbottle pocket, but it is a bit tall so if your pocket is short keep that in mind.",

As someone who's always on the go, I need a bottle that can keep up with my active lifestyle, and this one delivers. The FUNTAINER bottle is made of high-quality stainless steel that's durable and resistant to rust. The vacuum insulation is top-notch, keeping drinks hot for hours or cold for even longer. I've tested it with both hot coffee and cold water, and it's performed flawlessly. What I love most about this bottle is its versatility. The 16-ounce size is perfect for a morning coffee or a post-workout water, and the leak-proof lid makes it easy to take on the go. The bottle is also easy to clean and maintain, with a wide mouth that makes it simple to add ice or clean the interior. I've been impressed by the quality of this product, and I can tell it will last for years to come. The FUNTAINER bottle is a great value for the price, and I'm so glad I invested in it. **Pros:** * High-quality stainless-steel construction that's durable and resistant to rust * Top-notch vacuum insulation keeps drinks hot or cold for hours * Leak-proof lid makes it easy to take on the go * Easy to clean and maintain with a wide mouth * Great value for the price **Cons:** None! I hope this review helps others discover the benefits of this amazing, insulated bottle!",

      "text": "This is my son’s absolute favorite bottle — no smell, no slime buildup, and it looks really bright and high-quality. We use it every day and love it! Update after a couple of months of use: We've been using this bottle daily for a few months now, and the quality is still excellent. There's no sticky or slimy residue after water, which is a big issue we've had with many similar bottles. It stays clean, fresh, and pleasant to use. Very happy with how well it holds up over time.",

      "text": "The media could not be loaded. This has quickly become our favorite water bottle in the household. It is amazing and extremely durable. It has been thrown dropped, rolled down a hill and it still looks brand new. The silicone straw and little flap on the inside is very easily removed so I can clean it and we have taken this bottle to the park on a blazing hot day and the water has stayed cold for hours. It’s also the perfect size slightly smaller than a standard water bottle but perfect for a toddler. It’s very easy to carry with me. I could even throw it in my jacket pocket sometimes so I love the size. I love that there is a handle at the top. It makes it easy to carry even for my toddler. The design is just absolutely darling. It is very cute very aesthetically pleasing, and I love how it includes all of the characters in my daughter‘s favorite show. This bottle has never leaked while in my pocket or my bag. However it does leak when the top is open so keep that in mind. When the lid is fully closed, absolutely no water comes out of it.This is an amazing water bottle and I will definitely purchase other variations.",

      "text": "We have at least a dozen water bottles and this is probably my favorite to use for my kiddo and is the one we bring to school. It has all the features I was looking for: 1) Perfect size for a toddler to early grade school aged child, and fits small hands; 2) Made of stainless steel, sturdy yet not heavy for a toddler to carry; 3) Drinking spout is made of silicone, not plastic; 4) The best feature is that the lid closes over the spout and pops open with the touch of a button, ensuring that the mouthpiece keeps clean and covered when not in use, and your hand doesn’t have to touch it either. For hygiene reasons the lid was a really important design feature to us and was something I specifically looked for in a kids water bottle: that the mouthpiece is not exposed, the lid can be opened by a young child without effort and is attached to the bottle so won’t get lost; 5) Easy to clean and the silicone part pops off and on easily. The seal works well and the bottle has not leaked so far; 6) Keeps beverages cool or hot/warm for a good while. I haven’t tested how long, but for our purposes it’s fine for getting through a school day (not looking for rugged outback multi-day peak performance functionality here); 6) Also nice that they come in many colors and designs! It was surprisingly uncommon to find a water bottle that fit all these criteria, so I was really happy to come across this Thermos bottle that fit the bill! We’ve had ours for almost a year now and bring it to school daily, and it’s still working perfectly.",

Unfortunately mine did break after a few months. I was hoping it would survive more drops, but it didn’t. It’s still a really good water bottle. The outside doesn’t get sweaty, and my kid actually drinks more water because of it. I would definetly buy it again.",

The design is very elegant and flawless. I'm extremely happy with my purchase of this cup. It is heavy duty and I see it lasting a really long time. My son loves it!

      "text": "The YETI Rambler Jr. 12 oz Kids Bottle with the straw cap is definitely an investment, but it's one we’re so glad we made! While it’s on the pricier side, its durability and design have proven to be totally worth it. Our toddler is quite the little adventurer, and this bottle has survived countless tosses, drops, and spills without showing signs of damage. Unlike other kids' bottles that break or crack after just a few rough uses, this one stands up to the test. The straw cap is an excellent feature for young kids, making it easy for our toddler to drink from without making a mess. Plus, it’s spill-proof, which is a huge bonus when you’ve got a busy, active child. The bottle is also easy to clean, which is essential for us. We've thrown it in the dishwasher multiple times, and it’s still in great condition. We really appreciate the high-quality build of this bottle. The double-wall vacuum insulation keeps drinks cold for hours, which is perfect for both outdoor play and car trips. Whether it’s a hot summer day or a chilly winter outing, the YETI bottle keeps liquids at the right temperature, making it more convenient and enjoyable for our toddler to stay hydrated. The size is also ideal for little hands. It fits perfectly in our child’s grip, and the compact design makes it easy to throw into a diaper bag or backpack without taking up too much space. I’ll admit, it’s a bit on the expensive side compared to other bottles, but given how tough and well-made it is, I would recommend it to any parent with an active child. The quality and longevity of this product make it a wise investment, and I expect it to last us through many more years of use. If you're looking for a bottle that can withstand the wear and tear of toddler life and still look great, the YETI Rambler Jr. is a fantastic choice! Definitely worth the price for the peace of mind and the reliable performance.",

      "text": "We’ve gone through a lot of kids’ water bottles over the years, and the YETI Rambler Jr. is hands-down the toughest one we’ve owned. My kid has dropped it on pavement, tossed it in the car, and left it rolling around in a backpack, and it still looks and works like new. The insulation is top-tier: it keeps water ice-cold for hours, even on hot days at the park. The straw lid is genuinely leak-resistant when closed, which gives me peace of mind. (It’ll dribble a bit if left open and tipped, but that’s expected.) I also appreciate that it’s super easy to clean, dishwasher safe, and the straw disassembles without much fuss. The colors are vibrant and kid-friendly, and the handle makes it easy for little hands to carry. A couple of things to note: -> It’s heavier than a typical plastic bottle—something to consider if your kiddo prefers super lightweight gear. -> The straw has popped out a couple of times when refilling, but it’s easy to snap back in. Overall, it’s a great choice if you want a bottle that can survive serious kid use and still keep drinks cold all day. Worth the price for the quality and durability. Still need to keep an eye on the nooks and crannies for mild accumulation so I’d wash it every few days, maybe more in the summer. Easy enough to disassemble and clean though Would definitely buy again (and probably will once my younger one is old enough for one too). Update: make sure to check the interior of the cap unit for mold accumulation. Definitely think this should be washed multiple times per week.",

The straw can never just fall out (unlike some other brands) and it’s simple to use - put together. Everything being dishwasher safe is all nice for cleaning. It’s a good size for trips to the park or places you can refill. Not big enough for an all day hike, but I don’t think any kid’s water bottle is big enough for that. Does not leak if closed but will leak if the spout is open. I wouldn’t recommend if you are looking for a water bottle to leave in their bed or if you kid is too young to easily open and close it.",

It is very easy for him to use it and stay hydrated during the day. It is not heavy, easy to wash or dishwasher resistant. It works well, it is a really good deal for the price, it is not too expensive for the quality and it is very cute. The colors are accurate to the description and it has not changed for many times that I have washed it.",

They're dependable, they don't leak, they are designed and built really well, incredibly easy to clean and they last a really long time. 9.8 out of 10. MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS THE PACKAGING! If the person at this company that is in charge of packaging reads these reviews PLEASE STOP USING THE GLUE ADHESIVE ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BOTTLE!!! The water bottles arrive with minimal packaging, just a little double sided cardboard flap with product information on it. The issue is that the flaps are stuck to the side of the bottle with like NASA grade adhesive THAT DOES NOT COME OFF!!! You spend 10 minutes trying peel it off, trying to roll it off with the side of your thumb, I've tried dish soap and warm water solution, I've tried baby oil solution, I tried a plastic blade made for scraping dried residue off the inside of my grill, and yet, an adhesive smudge remains. These beautiful bottles forever marred with the residue of 1000% unnecessary adhesive. The company could actually save money if they stopped buying adhesive and it would make their product better. There is no reason that cardboard flap needs to be stuck down to the side of the bottle. I just bought a 2 pack of water bottles, each bottle has 2 globs of adhesive on EACH side. That's 8 globs of adhesive I now have to spend at least 15-20 minutes trying to remove as much as I can already knowing I'm going to fail. That's outrageous. I should have to spend ZERO minutes fighting with the packaging of a product.",

      "text": "Picture this: you're on a wild expedition with your little ones, braving the untamed wilderness of thirst. Suddenly, a pack of dinosaurs and sharks emerge from the depths of dehydration, threatening to make your kids as parched as a desert. But fear not, for Contigo Aubrey Kids Cleanable Water Bottle swoops in like a superhero, ready to save the day with its spill-proof lid and silicone straw! With this incredible 2-pack, your children will stay hydrated and entertained, while you can relax knowing that the dishwasher-safe design makes cleaning a breeze. Join me on a journey through my personal experience as we uncover the true magic of these marvelous water bottles. Let's dive right into the deep end and discuss the impeccable functionality of the Contigo Aubrey Kids Cleanable Water Bottle. The spill-proof lid is an absolute game-changer, keeping your little ones' drinks securely contained, even during the wildest adventures. I've witnessed this firsthand when my son, who possesses a knack for mischief, tried to perform a daring experiment of pouring his water bottle upside down while doing a handstand. Much to his surprise, not a single drop spilled! It was like watching a magic trick, leaving us all in awe. The peace of mind that comes with knowing that your child's backpack or lunchbox won't be swimming in a sea of liquid is simply priceless. Now, let's talk about the star of the show: the silicone straw. Contigo really hit the bullseye with this one! The soft and flexible straw not only makes drinking a breeze but also ensures that your little ones won't be left frustrated, trying to squeeze out the last drops of their drink. The straw allows for a smooth flow, keeping them hydrated without any effort. On a recent family trip to the zoo, my daughter fell head over heels for the vibrant shark-themed design on her water bottle. She enthusiastically exclaimed, \"Mom, I'm drinking from a shark's mouth!\" Needless to say, she sipped away happily, enjoying her little adventure with each gulp. Now, let's address the elephant in the room—or rather, the dishwasher. We all know that cleaning up after our kids can sometimes feel like a never-ending battle. But fear not, weary warriors of parenthood, for the Contigo Aubrey Kids Cleanable Water Bottle has come to the rescue! With its dishwasher-safe design, it's a breeze to keep these bottles squeaky clean. Gone are the days of scrubbing endlessly or resorting to strange contraptions to reach those hard-to-clean nooks and crannies. Just pop them in the dishwasher, and voila! They come out sparkling and ready for the next adventure. Trust me, this feature alone is worth its weight in gold. But wait, there's more! Contigo doesn't just stop at functionality; they know how to bring the fun factor as well. The Dinos & Sharks theme of the 2-pack water bottles is a roaring success among kids of all ages. The vibrant and eye-catching designs are like a mini art exhibit, capturing the imagination of your little explorers. I remember when my niece, who is quite the dinosaur aficionado, received her Contigo Aubrey Kids Cleanable Water Bottle. She immediately embarked on a journey to discover every dinosaur species depicted on her bottle, narrating her own prehistoric documentary as she sipped away. It was both educational and entertaining—an unexpected bonus that added extra value to this already fantastic product. In conclusion, the Contigo Aubrey Kids Cleanable Water Bottle is a must-have for any parent seeking hydration solutions that are both practical and thrilling. With its spill-proof lid, silicone straw",

It leaks with and without the straw if the spout is open so keep that in mind if looking for leakproof...this one is not and it will sweat if cold contents are poured in it.

It keeps their water nice and cold and they carry them everywhere with them. The colors are pretty and they love having different ones. As far as durability goes...they have held up well with being tossed and thrown and dropped so many times. One lost the top that brings up the spout but that was because my toddler chucked it with full force at the ground when it was open. Still works though and I'll most likely replace it with the same one once they get a little bigger because they are really nice.",

      "text": "When my daughter started preschool at 18 months, she joined the pre-toddlers class, which required her to have her own water bottle! I wanted one that would last her into elementary school but that was easy for her to use now, so we got this one. It's lovely, insulated, holds a reasonable amount of water, and easy for her to open and close. I love the little details like the pullable tab in the silicone gasket of the lid so that we can pull it out for washing and clear it of any smells without having to struggle to get between the silicone and the plastic to pull it out. It is well-made. She has dropped it dozens of times (often dozens of times per day!) at school, home, and at the playground, and the colours are still vibrant, without any dings or scratches. My only gripe is that the little silicone bumper at the bottom to allow it to be put down softly just never stays on. It fell off so often that we almost lost it, so we just never use it anymore.",

      "text": "My kids are notorious for losing or destroying water bottles. Seriously, it's a constant battle. But this CamelBak eddy+ Kids Water Bottle has been a game-changer! It's tough, leak-proof (a HUGE plus!), and my kids actually like using it. First off, the Tritan Renew material seems really durable. It's survived multiple drops, being thrown around in backpacks, and even a few accidental trips through the dishwasher (top rack, of course!). No cracks or leaks so far, which is a miracle in my house. The bite valve is easy for my kids to use, and it really does prevent leaks. I'm so tired of finding soggy backpacks and lunch bags! They can toss this bottle in their bag without me having to worry about spills. The flow is also just right – not too fast, not too slow. I also appreciate that it's easy to clean. The wide mouth makes it easy to get a sponge in there, and the bite valve comes apart for thorough cleaning. Hygiene is important, especially with kids, so this is a big plus. And let's not forget the fun designs! My kids were actually excited to pick out their own bottles, and they love the bright colors and patterns. It makes drinking water a little more fun for them, which is always a win. Honestly, this CamelBak eddy+ Kids Water Bottle is worth the investment. It's durable, leak-proof, easy to clean, and my kids love it. If you're looking for a water bottle that can withstand the rigors of childhood, I highly recommend this one. It's been a lifesaver in our house!",

My son drinks a lot of water, and this bottle holds plenty while still being light enough for him to carry around easily. Overall, it’s the perfect size for a toddler. The plastic is also good quality and very durable. My son has dropped this water bottle countless times and it has never cracked. It's easy to clean and I love that it is dishwasher safe. We've had this bottle for a while and the dishwasher has not ruined the quality at all. Word of caution though. If the bottle is full and your toddler likes to throw things, this WILL hurt your foot. Great water bottle and I would definitely recommend it!",

It’s definitely solid, high-quality, and the leak-proof seal works perfectly (tested with vigorous shaking and no spills at all). However, the built-in CamelBak-style bite-and-sip straw requires you to bite down gently while sucking for liquid to flow, which my toddler hasn’t quite mastered yet. I’m holding onto it until she’s a bit older, because once she figures out the straw mechanism, this will be perfect. Feature ratings: • Quality & Durability: ★★★★☆ • Leak-Proof Performance: ★★★★★ • Ease of Cleaning: ★★★★☆ • Toddler Usability: ★★☆☆☆ • Overall Value: ★★★★☆ Pros: • Solid, premium-feel construction • 100% leak-proof (no drops, even upside down) • Bite-and-sip CamelBak straw keeps liquid clean and hygienic • Easy to disassemble and clean Cons: • Straw requires biting and coordinated sucking—too advanced for young toddlers • Not ideal for children who haven’t learned to use bite-valve straws yet Recommendation: Great choice for preschoolers and older kids who know how to use a bite-and-sip straw. For younger toddlers, you may want to wait until they’ve mastered the biting action.",

      "text": "This line of stainless steel bottles has multiple sizes but they're constructed the same. This line is quality products. I have this one and two of the 12 oz bottles. They are constructed of stainless steel and they are coated in some sort of thermal coating that feels kind of like a high impact material. The coating has a texture to it, enough to make it easy to hold. The cap fits on very well. It tightens down securely and uses gasket for a firm seal, it doesn't allow any leaks and of course helps the bottle be thermal. The bottles have a nice look and feel and haven't shown any wear yet. I'm writing this after I bought the third bottle but I bought the first one six or seven months ago at least and it still shows nowhere. I use them mostly to hold cold water in the water stays cold all day, if I don't drink it first, of course. I also use them for coffee, and again it keeps the coffee hot for hours. Not quite as long as it keeps the cold liquids cold but it's still hours. The steel bottles are not only efficient but very very durable. Best of all they're not expensive! I own three so far but it looks like I may get a couple more, particularly because when I walk my dog she drinks all of the one I'm carrying even though I only pour the water into a small 3 oz cup. She will lap it up and then look at me till I pour more! I thought that would kind of trick her by using a small cup, but my Mini-Aussie is always way ahead of me!",

Functionality: It holds water and does not leak, sometimes if the bottle was on its side and you bring it upright and open it you will get wet because the cap will still have watet on it. Ease of use: I like that it holds just enough water for me. I like that its easy twist off design and keeps the water in. Durability: Ive dropped this bottle a few times and it still has no dents. Ease of cleaning: Pop this thing in the dishwasher and it's clean, super easy to clean.",

If you preheat the thermos with boiling water before filling it, it stays hot longer. Without preheating, it cools down faster. Overall, it works well.",

      "text": "After seeing all the reviews about mold on EVERY brand of kid's water bottle, I just had to come review this so I could say my piece. First, we had children's CamelBak bottles for 3 years now and they are great water bottles. For an inexpensive price I bought a package of replacement bite valves because my kids will chew on the valves and eventually they leak. This is normal wear and tear people. Second, any object that is subjected to bacteria is going to eventually grow something. It's not poison people. Just clean the darn thing. Get one of those little bottle brushes and really examine the bottle parts and make sure it's clean. If need be, dunk it briefly in a mixture of water and bleach and let it air dry. CamelBaks are great bc they really don't have a ton of parts so if you are of moderate intelligence you should be able to clean it. I know the big thing is to be scared of BLACK MOLD but it's often just the color of stuff growing.. You will find this happens on bath toys, those bulb nose snot suckers and anything that doesn't dry off between use. My experience with this water bottle is: It's durable! Kids fling it, drop it, drag it everywhere, chew on it, what have you and they don't break. It holds a nice amount of liquid. It's a great size at 4l (someone wrote that that is 14 oz). Many cups for kids are 10oz and that's just too small. It's cute and there are many designs to choose from. It's pretty leak proof. Sometimes through wear and tear on the bite valve or user error putting it back together, it has leaked a bit. But overall this thing is very leakproof.",

      "text": "My daughter is 3 she loves the designs of the cup. My son is 1 1/2 he is super picky when it comes to cups and this is the only cup he likes to drink from. We have about 6 of these cups and used most of them for over a year and some for almost 2. They are not leak proof. My son pushes the bite valve in to spill water out and my daughter loves super ice water (maraca water as we call it) but the pressure from cold to hot makes it leak. We only use for water because we would rather have water leak then anything else and our kids love water so it doesn't bug them. The bite valves will get bitten but I have replacements ready. My son bites hard on the cups and my daughter did at his age too. So I recommend buying replacement valves (they have kits with valves of all colors and some kits with extra straws) when getting the cups. The best thing about these cups is that they are so easy to clean. With and without dishwasher, we've done both. I never worried about them not being clean and with replacement pieces for almost everything (bite valve, straws, and caps) it is easier than other cups. Overall, we have used some of these cups for almost 2 years and bought more over time. They are the number one cups for our children and I dont see that changing anytime soon. They do have flaws but all things do just be prepared with extra bite valves and straws.",

Literally the only hiccup we have encountered with TONS of use is that eventually the mouth piece will start to leak as your kid beats it up by biting down on it all the time. However they make replacement mouth pieces you can get for cheap so I am completely fine with it. But we trust it not to leak enough to leave it in bed with him at night and when he is running around the house, get to have him carry it since its tough and leak proof.. and unlike some baby things, the straw/lid/mouthpiece/cup all come apart for easily to clean in the dishwasher",

      "text": "We love this water bottle! We bought one a while back for my 18 month old and it was great to carry around in the diaper bag. It was very easy for him to learn how to drink from it. Now he has a little brother (10 months old now) and he kept stealing it, so now we bought this one for boy #2. He learned how to drink from it very quickly and it's super easy for him, and not to heavy for him to hold when it's full of water. It's also pretty sturdy, my son throws it off the high chair quite often, and it usually is fine. Just as long as it doesn't happen to land straight on the mouthpiece on the floor, because that pushes the mouthpiece into the bottle, making an opening, and then there's tons of water on the floor. :) 4 Stars because sometimes it does leak. I think part of it might be a water pressure issue, putting cold water in it when it's really warm in the house or outside makes it leak more. But for the ease and how much the boys love it (they drink more water when I offer it versus other water cups) we deal with the leaking. But I wish CamelBak could somehow fix that- the larger water bottles we bought for my husband and I years ago do the same thing and it's been frustrating sometimes (BIG water spots on our seats in the car, etc.). Also, the mouth pieces get mold inside eventually; we have straw cleaners we use for other kid's cups with straws, and if you just pull it out (which is very easy to do with these kid's water bottles) you can scrub it down on the inside and keep it nice for a while. Although we did eventually have to buy replacement mouthpieces after about 6 months with the first water bottle we got for boy #1. There were some black spots we eventually couldn't clean out.",

Hatten schon einmal eine ähnliche Flasche von nuk - diese kann aber in keiner Lage hier mithalten! Allgemein schon viele Flaschen getestet aber diese isT die allerbeste die wir Bis jetzt hatten. Für die Reinigung kann die Flasche einfach zerlegt werden. Die Motive sind schön angebracht. Der Kauf lohnt.",

It’s a good size for kids hands (with an indentation at just the right spot for grip). And it’s got a nice fine mist (great when filled with ice water on a hot day). My only complaints are that it’s not easy to clean and while the size is good for a kid to handle, it can go fast when they’re using it to drink and mist (thankfully the mist is very fine so it doesn’t put out a ton at a time). Still, this is a great product and I’d buy it again!",

They keep her water cold for her various sports, the size is good, and they look great. We also decorated them with vinyl stickers and they are holding up well. They are hand wash only, but I do wash the caps in the dishwasher with no issues. The color was perfect for both boys and girls. (We also bought a pack of the light purple and they were a hit with both as well.) I also love that they came with 2 options for lids: the straw lid and the bottle lid. Overall, great value. I would buy them again without hesitation.",

Cleaning is very easy and it keeps drinks cold for a very long time. I bought this as a gift for a friend who is getting married. The surface is perfect for the vinyl decal I made to personalize it for her. These are also great for people who craft because there is no logo on the bottle that will interfere with your design. The vinyl sticks incredibly well, making this a great gift that will last a long time. The downside to this bottle is that it doesn’t fit in a standard cup holder. Most comparable bottles this size have the same issue. The price is also much lower than other brands and the quality is just as good.",

It’s easy for him to carry himself, fits in the side of his backpack & lunch bag, the seal is great (no leaks thus far), he still has some ice when he comes from school even after getting more water so yes it keeps water cold for a long period. Very easy to clean daily! Very durable",

      "text": "This cup is perfect for kids! I've tried so many different cups/bottles for my son & rarely find any I like. My main issue with most of them is how difficult/impossible the lids are to wash properly! Unless u have a dishwasher, (which I don't), its extremely hard, if not literally impossible to clean every nook & cranny in some of the lids & pieces! Even with my special tiny brushes I got for this exact purpose, I often still can't access areas to clean them well. That is not an issue with this cup! Every area is accessible for thorough cleaning, which is rare for a spill-proof lid! So that alone scored major points with me. Also, I love that it's very durable. After a few months of use, my son still hasn't broken or even dented it, which is amazing! Plus, it keeps drinks ice cold for a long time. I can send this cup to school with my son & his drink stays cold all day! Other perks are: •the spill proof lid •its easy for kids to use •it has a hard plastic spout, not a squishy soft nubby which can be bad for dental health Finally, the best part is the great price! Most kids no-spill, insulted, durable (metal) cups (especially cups that hold more than 8-10oz) are too expensive! With how easily my son loses or breaks them, there's NO WAY I'm spending $15-25+ on a cup for my kid! Finding one of this quality & size with such a near perfect design for this price is unheard of! This is a crazy good deal!! I definitely recommend it. Point being, u don't have to shop around or hesitate.. I'm telling u now.. this cup is great & well worth the cost! U won't regret this purchase, I promise!!",

The material feels high-quality and durable, and I love that it’s eco-friendly. Additionally, the leak-proof lid gives me peace of mind when tossing it in my bag.

Thought it was not closed properly but nope it was leaking, also there is no true insulation. Got it the second time because it was the only one which was same day delivery and my daughter wanted this pink colour one for school next day and did not want to Wait , this one was thankfully leak proof. I did not return the bad one as I missed the return window, this product could not be return at any ups and there where specific locations only for return dono why I guess Amazon or the manufacturer/seller is making it difficult for easy returns so I have the bottle for now. Don't really recommend it because it's not really insulated",

Me parece buen producto ya que hasta el momento no ha sufrido derrames. Muy fácil de limpiar. Mantiene las cosas calientes por un buen tiempo (En mi caso 7 hrs está súper bien para tener una bebida) Una ventaja muy importante es que no es muy grande. Sus dimensiones me parecen adecuadas para llevarlo en cualquier lonchera o mochila. Con respecto al embalaje me pareció muy simple, ya que lo entregan con una etiqueta tipo collar en el termo y este a su vez envuelto en borbuja. Todo esto dentro de una caja. También incluye un pequeño manual de uso.",

En cuanto a la calidad, es excelente. Tiene buen tamaño (un poco más grande que otros termos que ha tenido), está hecho con material resistente, por dentro conserva muy bien el frío y la tapa también es fuerte y segura.

      "text": "The DOMICARE 40 oz Insulated Water Bottle has quickly become an essential part of my daily routine, and I can confidently say it delivers on every promise. Whether you're staying hydrated at the gym, on a hike, or during a long workday, this bottle is the perfect companion for keeping beverages cold, fresh, and easily accessible. Design and Build Quality The black stainless steel design is sleek, modern, and durable. The matte finish not only looks great but also provides a comfortable grip. It feels sturdy in hand, and the double-wall vacuum insulation ensures exceptional performance. Even on hot days, the exterior remains condensation-free, which is a huge plus when carrying it in a bag or placing it on furniture. Insulation Performance This water bottle excels at keeping drinks cold for hours. I tested it with ice water, and even after 12 hours, there were still ice cubes inside—a testament to its superior insulation. While I haven’t used it for hot beverages yet, I have no doubt it would perform equally well based on its solid build and insulation design. Versatility and Convenience The inclusion of both a straw lid and a spout lid is a thoughtful touch. The straw lid is perfect for easy sipping during workouts or when driving, while the spout lid is ideal for quick hydration on the go. Both lids are leakproof, so I never worry about spills, even when the bottle is tossed in a bag. The wide-mouth opening makes it easy to add ice or clean thoroughly. Eco-Friendly and Practical The bottle's reusable design aligns with my commitment to reducing single-use plastics. Its 40 oz capacity ensures I stay hydrated throughout the day without needing constant refills, and it’s lightweight enough to carry around without being cumbersome. Final Thoughts The DOMICARE 40 oz Insulated Water Bottle is an outstanding product that combines style, functionality, and durability. It's versatile enough to meet the needs of an active lifestyle, yet practical for everyday use. If you're looking for a reliable, high-performance water bottle that looks great and delivers on insulation, this is an excellent choice. Highly recommended!",

The bottle comes with the straw and spout. It doesn't leak at all. He has carried it 2 weeks and it's working great. He can only take water to school so I put ice and water in it and he says it's cool all day. He usually only drinks one bottle a day but has the option to fill it up durning the day. My grandson drinks water only at home or school. With his water in the morning his water after school dinner before bed the water bottle takes care of the school days. It's eafor him to carry with the top having a small handle. He says he's happy with this water bottle and it's not so heavy like the larger ones. It's one of the lightest weight ones we have bought and we have bought many in the last 7 years of him going to school.",

I did a test with water at 44.2F and 12 hours after it was at 53.2F which for me is very good, especialy on hot summer rides to come. The reason I graded it at 4 is that the straw that comes with this bottle does not fit the bottle cap inner tube adapter, it is way to big and does not hold into place at all. I will be using this bottle with the other bottle cap that comes with it, it has no straw adapter on the cap permitting me to drink directly from it. I recommend this isolated bottle if you plan drinking directly from it without the need of the straw because the one that comes with it is totally useless. I did not try with hot beverages since I will not use it for that purpose.",

      "text": "Nalgene remains the most reliable water bottle in the market. Tried and tested (I have a good 20 of them), these bottles are durable, can be used for multiple purposes-- I use them as water bottles but also use them to store rice and pulses in the kitchen, as well as to store juice to keep in the fridge and hot herbal teas to carry on the go. I have also used some to store beads, screws, crayons, and virtually anything that needs organizing. In terms of liquid, they hold hot and cold effectively and they are leak proof. The wide mouth is excellent to drink and makes cleaning them a breeze. I also like that they clean well and do not hold any smells. Notably, these bottles are clumsy-hands friendly. The smaller size of this one is great to carry out and about in my hand but it also takes minimal space in my handbag and backpack. The colour is lovely! The combo of the deep red and yellow/mustardy lid is very quirky. I would totally recommend!",

      "text": "This little Nalgene bottle surprisingly versatile. As an avid backpacker, I'm always looking for dual use items and this fits the bill. I love the Nalgene brand and have used their 1L bottles for a long time. As I've started to reduce the weight of my pack I swapped out the heavy Nalgene for smart water bottles unless I'm going somewhere there is snow. This bottle is the best of both worlds. It's the same great materials but lighter in the weight department. It can hold boiling water and not melt. It's great to take a hot water bottle into your sleeping bag when its cold. It fits in my shoulder holster, so it's great for quick access to electrolytes. I also use it for dehydrating vegetables. I pour in the water in the morning and my veggies are ready to cook at dinner time. No worries about it opening in my pack as Nalgene is a brand you can trust. I also use it for rehydrating meat but that's only for about 15 minutes and its the perfect container for sun tea. Give it a try, you'll be surprised at how useful this bottle can be!",

The small size is great for my post-run recovery shake. I can keep the powder in this and bring along a larger Nalgene for filling it plus extra water for hydration OR I can bring just it filled with the correct amount of water and the recovery powder in a baggy to add when I need it. It is small and convenient to carry. The colors are vibrant and fun! I also sometimes use it as a pre-run electrolyte hydration drink. Just chug it on my drive to the trail. This way I am not overdoing it by filling a large Nalgene and overdrinking. I love them and this is my fourth purchase of them. My tween kids borrow them constantly.",

It would be easy to clean. 2) The color is cool and pleasant to the eyes! 3) It looks cute and is easy to carry. 4) It seems durable. Some drawbacks: 1) It’s not very convenient to screw the cap single-handedly. 2) Due to the small size, the weight ratio of bottle cap to bottle body is high, so when the bottle is empty, it might not stand still. 3) Since its mouth is so wide, I find this bottle not the best for hikes as it can easily spill. So carefully consider if you are looking for a bottle with daily capacity to be used in an outdoor setting, but otherwise, it’ll be a worthwhile purchase!",

The seal is great on all three and does not spill. It is easy for her to change out the lids, fill with water/drink of choice and get the lid back on. It is the perfect size, keeps her drinks cold throughout the day and fits in her backpack nicely. We have washed it in the dishwasher several times and has held up nicely with no issues or damage. Will definitely be buying more.",

Featuring bold artwork and cute designs with kids' favorite characters, this drinkware will help anyone get excited about an everyday routine. This drinking bottle is made from durable plastic, which is lightweight and sturdy enough to stand up to everyday wear and tear for kids with active lifestyles.

A built-in loop makes it easy to carry the bottle by hand, and it fits in most car cup holders as well. The straw can be removed from the bottom of the lid for cleaning, though the spout and cover aren't designed to be disassembled. The lid can be washed in the top rack of the dishwasher.",

What I love: Vibrant, fun design – The graphics are bold and instantly recognizable. My son literally smiles every time he uses his “Creeper cup.” Kid-friendly and durable – They're the perfect size for small hands and have survived multiple dishwasher cycles and a couple of accidental drops with no issues. No leaks (so far) – The lids screw on tight and haven’t leaked in lunchboxes or in the car.",

It holds more water that a compact 1-cup bottle and a bit less than popular Nalgene-style bottles that are sold for camping (see size comparison pic). The advantage over the Nalgene is that it keeps items colder for longer and can also be used for hot liquids. I have a strong preference for tube-shaped bottles. They're easier to clean. I prefer the compact bottles over the big ones since I have to bring them into meetings and they need to be somewhat unobtrusive. This bottle holds enough water to last most of the day without standing out more than it should. It's also a good lunch-box bottle. Extra straw attachment included.",

      "text": "This review pertains to the Mollcity 12 oz flask. The straw has a weak attachment inside the lid. The attachment point is offset straw so if the bottle is packed with ice the straw can be knocked out of the holder as it is twisted closed. Although the 14 oz flask also has an offset straw, its attachment is more secure and doesn’t get pulled out. I have both and they both keep drinks cold. I fill them half full of ice a night and there is usually ice left 24 hours later. I do recommend either size though. I would prefer that the straw is centered so ice doesn’t trap it but the design doesn’t allow that. I’ve used other brands that do have a central straw but the mouthpiece is soft silicone tubing which picks up food stains and is hard to clean. The Mollcity bottles have hard plastic mouthpieces which I think are more hygienic.",
